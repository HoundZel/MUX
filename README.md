# FYP A2097-241
## A web-page-based software program for Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) of Digital Multiplexers

### Introduction
    The idea of this Final Year Project(FYP) is to create a web application 
    for students to practise/ revise their concept on multiplexers.

### Multiplexer
    What are *Multiplexers* ?
    The multiplexer is a combinational logic circuit designed to switch 
    one of several input lines to a single common output line.
    
    For the EE2104 curriculum, we are focusing on 4 multiplexers, namely the:
    + 2-to-1
    + **4-to-1**
    + **8-to-1**
    + 16-to-1

### Features to implement 
    1. randomly generated multiplexer questions and have users key-in
       / pick the correct ans. (MUX and DMUX) (minterm & maxterm)
    2. showcase the internals of a MUX/DMUX ?

### current progress
    NONE
